## Discussion
The problems that I had was putting the elements in order so they all appear on the screen. I had to research some of the information that I didn't exactly remember, and other styles that we haven't learned yet. The errors that I had were simple it just took me a bit to find the error with all of the code. I think I would apply what I learned in this project to future projects. The parts of the project that I found challenging was to change the order of elements and to figure out how to change it, I found out that you need to use the z-Index in order to change it. I don't think I would change anything about the project. The process that I went through to create the program is first reviewing the code from before, thinking about the design of the card, testing new things and if they work,  starting on the greeting card and finishing it.

## Testing
I tested my project by looking at the code back and forth checking everything is right. Show to my peers to see what they think what I should make better or change.
